This Github repository contains the code used to implement and run age-stratified, metapopulation compartmental models using odin.dust. These models are used to analyse the dynamics of measles outbreaks in England between 2010 and 2019. The figures generated by the scripts can be found in the Output folder. The R folder contains all the scripts and functions:

* `R/model_odin_dust.R`: Define the odin.dust model.
* `R/script_generate_output.R`: Run the model, define the input variables, generate the figures
